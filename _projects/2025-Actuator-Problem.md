For this course project, we had to engineer a mechanism that fit within a defined 2D workspace. Using a single rigid link, three pin joints, and a linear actuator selected from a real manufacturer catalog, our goal was to design a system capable of raising the greatest possible load to the highest achievable position. The assignment utilized mechanical analysis to produce a fully functional lifting mechanism.

The final configuration placed a rigid bar hinged to the ground at one end, with the linear actuator connected to the opposite end. The actuator was mounted on a pivot so it could freely rotate and continuously push normal to the bar. This arrangement functioned as a lever, where the actuator’s input force countered the moment generated by the load. Through detailed geometric analysis, we found that the actuator’s minimum body length and required stroke restricted how far the bar could rotate, which in turn limited the attainable angles and the maximum height the system could lift.

A Tolomatic IMA55 actuator with a roller screw was chosen from the catalog because its peak thrust capacity of 23,900 N enabled the mechanism to lift loads exceeding 2,400 kg under optimal geometric conditions. Its stroke and housing dimensions were evaluated to verify that the actuator could be accommodated within the 150 cm × 50 cm design envelope. Static analysis further illustrated how the required actuator force varies with the bar’s angle, as well as how the actuator’s minimum and maximum lengths ultimately define the lowest and highest attainable lifting positions.

To optimize both lifting height and load capacity, I analyzed the system by taking moments about the bar’s ground hinge. This approach made it possible to calculate the actuator’s peak force demand at various bar angles. Because the actuator is pin-mounted and transmits force only along its axis, the usable lifting force is governed by how the weight projects onto the actuator’s line of action.

The limiting condition arises when the actuator is at its minimum length, placing the bar at its smallest angle and requiring the actuator to counter the highest torque from the load. In this position, I used geometric relationships to determine how much of the weight vector aligned with the actuator’s axis. By dividing the actuator’s peak thrust by this projected component, I obtained the maximum load the mechanism could lift under this configuration.

This project showed me how to merge manufacturer specifications with practical mechanical design, and how to navigate trade-offs such as maximizing lifting capability while adhering to tight spatial constraints. It emphasized the value of evaluating geometry, force paths, and component limitations as a unified system during the early stages of mechanism development.

# Actuator Problem Portfolio Update

## Step 1: Rigid Bar Analysis

### a) Problem Definition, Constraints/Objectives, Degrees of Freedom

**Problem Definition:**  
Design a mechanism that uses an actuator to lift a load through a specified displacement. The mechanism includes a bar initially assumed to be rigid.

**Constraints:**

- Must support the applied load without plastic deformation.
- Actuator must operate within its stroke limits.
- Mechanism geometry must stay within the assigned design envelope.

**Objectives:**

- Achieve the required output displacement.
- Minimize required actuator force.
- Keep mechanism simple and light.

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF):**  
The mechanism has one degree of freedom, which is the rotation of the rigid bar driven by the actuator.

### b) Static Analysis of the Rigid Bar

My static analysis process:

- Summation of forces and moments about the pivot.
- Relationship between actuator force and external load.
- Geometric relations between actuator length, bar angle, and output position.

### c) Final Rigid Mechanism Design

This figure illustrates the overall geometry of the lifting mechanism within the 150 cm × 50 cm design envelope. Points A, B, and C represent the three pin connections: the bar is fixed to the ground at A, the actuator attaches to the bar at B, and its base is pinned to the ground at C, allowing it to rotate freely. The sketch shows the actuator at a representative configuration, forming an angle φ with the ground while the bar is at angle θ. The applied load W acts near the bar’s upper region. On the right, the cross-section drawing provides key dimensions for the bar geometry, including a 50 mm total height and 25 mm outer width, with a 21 mm × 46 mm internal hollow. These dimensions and pin placements define the kinematics and allowable range of motion for the system.

## Step 2: Beam (Flexible Bar) Analysis

### a) Maximum Beam Deflection

Once you consider flexibility, the bar behaves as a beam subjected to transverse forces:

1. The load being lifted  
2. The transverse component of the actuator force  

Assumptions:

- Prismatic, linearly elastic beam
- Small-deflection Euler–Bernoulli beam theory
- Only transverse loading considered


For a cantilever with tip load \(F\):

```text
δ_max = (F * L^3) / (3 * E * I)
```

### b) Beam Design to limit deflection below 2% of length

Requirement:

```text
δ_max < 0.02 * L
```

To satisfy this, I selected a cross-section and material such that:

```text
I > (F * L^3) / (3 * E * 0.02 * L)
```
Where:

- L is the distance between A and B 
- a is the distance from A to the applied load
-
